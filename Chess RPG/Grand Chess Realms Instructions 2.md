            GRAND CHESS REALMS
--------------------------------------------------

Welcome, Traveler!
As you journey through the realms, please note:

1. **Physical Chess Board Usage:**  
   To fully immerse yourself in the game, we encourage you to keep a real-life chess board in front of you at all times. Arrange your pieces as described by the narrative, and use it to track every move.

2. **Algebraic Notation:**  
   All moves must be entered using standard algebraic notation (e.g., e2e4, Nf3). This ensures clarity and aligns with the classical chess experience.

3. **Interface & Commands:**  
   - Use the on-screen prompts to navigate the world.  
   - When a chess battle is initiated, refer to your physical board for the current position.
   - Input your moves via the terminal using algebraic notation.
