## Gameplay

### Roleplaying
- Players interact with the world and NPCs through dialogue and actions. The AI DM will describe the outcomes and consequences of their choices.
- Use the AI to determine the success of various actions, such as persuasion, exploration, and combat.

### Chess Battles
- Major conflicts and battles are resolved through full chess matches on the physical board.
- The AI DM will set the scene and describe the stakes of the battle. Players will then play a standard chess match to determine the outcome.
- The player's success or failure in the chess match will influence the story's progression.

## Importance of a Real Chess Set

Having a real chess set in front of you is crucial for immersion. It not only enhances the experience but also helps you visualize the game's events and strategies. Using a physical board will benefit you in the long run by improving your chess skills and deepening your connection to the game.

## Using Stockfish for NPCs

To add an extra layer of challenge and realism, use the Stockfish chess engine to control NPCs during chess battles. Configure Stockfish to an appropriate Elo level based on the NPC's skill. This will provide a fair and engaging experience for all players.

### Configuring Stockfish
1. **Download and Install**: Download the Stockfish chess engine from the official website and install it on your device.
2. **Set Elo Level**: Configure Stockfish to the desired Elo level for the NPC. This can be adjusted based on the difficulty of the encounter.
